Udemy TailwindCSS course

Learning TailwindCSS through Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/tailwind-css-course/).

File will contain a sandbox where I will just play around with TailwindCSS (won't see a lot of git uploaded from here).
File will also contain projects inwhich will prepare me for possible real world situations.

Feel free to reach out to me and let me know where I could improve, thank you!
